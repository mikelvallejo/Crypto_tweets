# Crypto_tweets

  

This project aims to demonstrate a possible causality between the variations of cryptocurrencies and the tweets of the founder of Tesla, Elon Musk.

Data from different sources was taken and joined in the same dataframe to analyse it correctly.

The final visualization was made through Tableau.

  


You will find three main documents in this repository:

 1. The playground with all the process on a Jupyter Notebook.
 2. The .py file with the clean code
 3. The rest of de data sources and outputs in .xlsx and .csv.
