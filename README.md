# Crypto_tweets

This project aims to demonstrate a possible causality between the variations of cryptocurrencies and the tweets of the founder of Tesla, Elon Musk.
Data from different sources was taken and joined in the same dataframe to analyse it correctly.
The final visualization was made through Tableau.
